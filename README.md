# Movie-Recommender
Implemented two types of recommender systems:
- <b>Demographic Filtering</b> - User gets recommendations based on movie popularity. 
- <b>Content Based Filtering</b> - User gets recommendatons based on the movie's metadata like director, actors, genre, keywords etc.

### How did I achieved it
-	Python libraries like NumPy, Pandas and Matplotlib are used to manipulate and visualize data. 
- TF-IDF, linear kernel and cosine similarities from scikit-learn library are used to generate similarity score matrix to recommend the most relevant movies.
- Detailed step by step explanation can be found in the attached code (Movie_Recommender.ipynb)

### Dataset
-	TMDb dataset of about 5000 movies (attached)
